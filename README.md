Sync Chrome Bookmarks with Safari Bookmarks on macOS

1. Open Chrome
2. Run itoln.applescript
3. In pop-up dialog from Chrome, make sure Favorites/Bookmarks is selected for import, then click the Import button 

This is particularly useful if you use iCloud to sync your bookmarks in Safari but occassionally need to use Chrome (e.g., when you need Flash) and want to have your bookmarks available in Chrome.
